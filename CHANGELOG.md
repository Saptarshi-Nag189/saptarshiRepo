# Changelog

## [0.1.0]

First release.

### New
- Follows whatever is playing on the phone (Spotify, YouTube Music, Apple Music, any player)
  once notification access is granted. Onboarding opens the right settings screen.
- Kinetic, word-synced lyrics: seven layouts (Stack, Slide, Zoom, Letters, Scatter, Graph,
  Flow) picked per line from pace, length and chorus repeats. Words fill left to right as they
  are sung; 1 to 3 words per line glow in colours taken from the album art.
- Lyrics from LRCLIB, cached on the phone and retried every minute while a song plays.
  Enhanced LRC word timings are used when present; otherwise timings are estimated
  (syllables for Latin text, aksharas for Hindi and Bengali).
- Romanised subtitle under Japanese, Hindi or Bengali lines when the lyrics include one.
- Liquid glass background on Android 13 and later, with ripples from each sung word.
  Animated gradient on older phones. Artwork blur or solid colour in settings.
- Tap the stage for controls: seek, play and pause, skip, layout picker, and a sync nudge
  (250 ms steps, saved per song). Long-press to lock the current layout.
- Import an .lrc file for any song. Unsynced lyrics scroll slowly and are clearly marked.
- Reduce motion setting (also automatic when system animations are off): fades only.
- Debug screens: now playing and clock, lyrics list, FitCheck.

### Known limits
- Not yet tested on many devices. Report anything that looks wrong.
